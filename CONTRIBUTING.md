# Contributing to the UKHO .NET Developers Guild Repo

Firstly, thank you for taking the time to contribute.

These are only guidelines for contributing to this repo, not hard rules. They may not fit all scenarios encountered, so please use your best judgment and feel free to propose a change to this document via a pull request if you think it can be improved.

## Questions

If you have any questions, please open an issue or contact a guild member (best route is via the UKHO Yammer group).

## Improvements

If you have any improvements (things being poorly worded, misspelt, unclear, tweaks) please make a pull request.

## Change

If you would like to make changes and contributions to ongoing projects, the best approach is to discuss it with other guild members then open an issue with the details/ideas so we can discuss the changes before a pull request is made. If no issue is made before a pull request we will still consider it, however there is chance the your effort is wasted if we don't accept your pull request in :(
